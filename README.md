## FriendsOverJAM
This hackathon project is built to demonstrate **JAMStack** approach to building a simple game. More importantly, it was built by a group of people who are learning React and worked hard over two days to learn how to write an application in React. 

### WordGame
A simple game of words between two people. The goal of the game is to respond with a Word that starts with the last letter of the word given to you by your opponent, within a time limit. 

### The friendly questionnaire
How alike are you and your friend? Answer questions and get a score if both have given the same answers!

## This is a project madde at the JAMstack Freecodecamp Hackaton 2018. This forked project has minor improvements and typos corrections over the original one that was submited to the contest - all in the "The friendly questionnaire" minigame. The overall design of the site and the "WordGame" were done by other team members. "The friendly questionnaire"" minigame was done by me (of course, with help from other team members).
